# Cybersecurity Internship Project

## Project Overview
As part of the CISCO AICTE VIP 2024 program, I designed and architected a hybrid working environment for faculty and students at my college.

## Problem Statement
- **Design a secure hybrid working environment**: Faculty members use college-provided laptops to access resources from home and on campus, while students use personal devices.
- **Network security requirements**: Campus network services should be restricted to private networks and not exposed to the public internet.

## Solution
- **Network Topology**: Updated the campus network topology with new security components.
- **Security Options**: Explored various network security options and implemented the most effective solutions.
- **Risk and Advantage Analysis**: Detailed analysis of the proposed solutions, highlighting the risks and advantages.

## Files Included
- `BhushanWayal.pkt `: Packet Tracer file for the updated network topology.
